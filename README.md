# Stormy Takes Over
![Screenshot](screenshots/screenshot.png)

A Pok√©mon-inspired game, satirizing the current ridiculous
drama about president Trump's sex life
(news flash - nobody cares!).

Despite being merely `"for the lulz"`, this game is actually
a complete turn-based battle system implemented using
Phaser.
